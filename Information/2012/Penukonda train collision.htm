only the loco pilot had been alert. Under such circumstances, the loco pilot

station until the goods train moved out of Penukonda railway station, said
experts after a preliminary examination of the accident spot. Nevertheless,

co-pilot Balaraju escaped, probably because they jumped out of the train
immediately after applying the emergency brake. Had they not applied the brake,
the impact of the collision would have spread to more coaches increasing the
toll, the safety engineers said. Speaking to&nbsp;<a

Bhagwan, said he had no clue that the train had actually jumped a danger signal
that denied entry into Penukonda station. He said that he was among the first
to run into the station for help and denied rumours that himself or the pilots
tried to escape. Meanwhile, experts in the signalling system for the railways
at Guntakal said an enquiry into the incident would bring out the truth. They
denied any possibility of the driver having been under the influence of
alcohol, as all pilots were subjected to a&nbsp;<a

The public relations officer (PRO) of Indian Railways, Anil Saxena, said that
rescue operations at the train collision site at Penukonda in Andhra Pradesh is
almost over with most passengers being sent to their respective destinations
safely. &quot;Relief and rescue operation is almost over, most of the coaches
have been tackled but the last coach which was being tackled was the SLR coach
next to the engine, that has also been tackled and now the technician team and
the officials and the staff there, some of them have entered the coach to
ascertain any possible survivors. All the injured have been admitted in the
Penukonda hospital and Puttaparthi hospital,&quot; said Saxena. When asked
about the disruption of traffic on the route, he explained that the traffic was
not disrupted on the section as one line was made functional immediately after
the crash the previous morning and only some trains had to be delayed while one
train was cancelled. As far as the stranded passengers were concerned of the
ill-fated train, they all were taken to their respective destinations. Some of
them were transported through 10 buses that were arranged by the railways, some
of them were taken through Rajdhani and Udyan Express which was passing through
that route.</span></p>
