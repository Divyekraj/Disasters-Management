driver of the Doon Express had seen some distortion in the railway track and as
a result, applied the brakes. Ten coaches along with the engine safely passed
through the damaged track. However, seven coaches at the rear got derailed. The
place where the accident took place is 35&nbsp;km from Jaunpur railway station
and 70&nbsp;km from Varanasi. Officers of the district administration along
with ambulances and medical care reached the spot in half an hour. Senior
officials including the divisional railway manager from Lucknow also rushed to
the spot. The railways dispatched three relief trains from Lucknow,&nbsp;<a

incident,&quot; said Ms Banerjee who was Railways Minister herself till she was
elected chief minister in 2011. Railways Minister Mukul Roy left for the
accident site while he ordered a high-level probe into the accident. &quot;I
have ordered a high-level inquiry to find out why such repeated accidents are
happening. We will take serious steps to prevent such accidents,&quot; he said.

of those killed; Rs. 1 lakh for those injured and Rs. 25,000 for those who have
